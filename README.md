## To prepare this data, the data was cleaned, and the following processes were performed:

### Exploratory Data Analysis
    - During the exploratory data analysis, a boxplot and histogram was visualized for each numeric datatype column. 
    - Also, a barplot was visualized for each categorical column. 
    - This gave a good baseline for all of the numeric and categorical columns for univariate EDA.

- Here we can see the quantity of different store sizes.

- Here we can clearly see that in the barplot there's several outliers in the Outlet Establishment Year column. These could be valid data points, or they could be an error among the dates.

- Data shows that it's median is around the late 1990's is when more stores opened.
